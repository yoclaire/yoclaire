# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yoclaire

## ðŸŒŸ About Me

Iâ€™m passionate about **information security**, **infrastructure automation**, and **cats**. Currently, Iâ€™m honing my skills in **Python**, **Terraform**, and **Git**, and diving back into **Go** and **JavaScript**. I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projectsâ€”especially those with a bit of mischief.
