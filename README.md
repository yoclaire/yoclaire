- 👋 Hi, I’m @yoclaire
- 👀 I’m interested in all things information security (and cats)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Terraform, and improving Git skills
- 💞️ I’m always happy to collaborate on interesting projects, especially if they have the potential for mischief
- 📫 How to reach me (please don't) (unless you're a work colleague, then just slack me)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: can roller skate on one foot backwards, juggle, and tie a cherry stem with my tongue. haven't tried all three at the same time... yet.
