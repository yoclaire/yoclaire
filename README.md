- 👋 Hi, I’m @yoclaire
- 👀 I’m interested in all things information security, infrastructure automation, and cats
- 🌱 I’m currently improving Python, Terraform, and Git skills. Learning Go and getting back into JavaScript are also on the to do list..
- 💞️ I’m always happy to collaborate on interesting projects, especially if they have the potential for mischief
- 📫 How to reach me (please don't) (unless you're a work colleague, then just slack me)
